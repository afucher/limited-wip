This is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA (http://www.jetbrains.com/idea).
It reverts active change list every N minutes.

How to use it
-------------
 - choose how often to revert changes in Settings - VCS auto-revert
 - start auto-revert (alt+shift+A or click on widget in the toolbar)
 - work on a feature:
   - if your changes auto-reverted before you finish and commit,
     start over and probably think how to make smaller steps
   - if you finish and commit before you run out of time, timer will be reset.
 - if you use really small time intervals (like 2 or 5 minutes), there won't be much
   time to write commit messages. In this case "Quick commit" action can be useful (ctrl+alt+shift+K).


How I use it
------------
I have been using it mostly when writing code katas (http://http://codekata.pragprog.com) with 2 minute auto-revert interval.
It was one of the most mind-changing experiences when I had to think of a insanely small steps to fit into 2 minutes
(assuming I cannot commit uncompilable code). It led me to "not doing clever" things and thinking how to evolve code
without causing "unpredictable" cascade of changes.
Yes.. it was on a small scale of 2 minutes but it has definitely affected the way I work with real code.

Besides, I found that it gives me a lot of excitement similar to the one you get from playing computer games.
I'm frustrated when changes are reverted. And I'm proud when I manage to finish in time.

This is still a very experimental thing. At least for me. If you actually use it, please send some feedback.


Potential use-cases
-------------------
 - to teach yourself proper TDD. Set up auto-revert to 2 minutes or so. Focus only on one part of red-green-refactor cycle. (See http://jamesshore.com/Blog/Red-Green-Refactor.html or http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd)
 - to limit work-in-progress. Auto-revert forces you to commit or lose changes. If committed changes are at least compilable, you won't get involved in big bang refactorings and code changes. It's like Pomodoro but you have to finish something. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)
 - not to be too attached to your code. If it's reverted, just write again and probably it will be better this time. (See http://blog.jayfields.com/2009/03/kill-your-darlings.html)
 - it's fun because it's like arcade computer game.
 - it's an experiment to see your limits.
