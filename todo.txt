TBD:
 - quick commit action (probably using current task description as a commit comment)
 - disable commit if project doesn't compile
 - stats about average commit time (proportion to currently configured timeout, etc)

Problems / questions:
 - should reset timer on user revert?
 - probably should detect commit dialog being open and don't revert in this case
 - still get errors when commit overlaps auto-revert
 - still get "reload from file system" popup questions
